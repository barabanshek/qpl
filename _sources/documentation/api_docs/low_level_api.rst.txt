Low-level C API
###############


This document describes the Intel® Query Processing Library (Intel® QPL)
Low-level API (also called as Job API). The document provides descriptions 
of the main entities and operations used.

For general introduction to Intel QPL, see :ref:`Introduction
<introduction_reference_link>`.


**Disclaimer**

The library exists in a prototype form and is being actively developed. This
means that some things described here may change in the future. However,
this is being released now in the expectation that it will be more
useful than nothing to people initially trying to use the library.
