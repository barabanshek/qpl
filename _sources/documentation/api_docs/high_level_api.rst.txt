High-level C++ API
##################


This document describes the Intel® Query Processing Library (Intel® QPL)
High-level API. The document provides descriptions of the main entities and operations used.

For general introduction to Intel QPL, see :ref:`Introduction
<introduction_reference_link>`.


**Disclaimer**

The library exists in a prototype form and is being actively developed. 
This means that some of the things described here may change in the future. 
However, the library is released now with the expectation that it will be more 
useful than nothing to people who may use it.
